## Predicting Playoff teams with Bayesian Inference

This analysis looks at different metrics of NBA playoff teams measured throughout an NBA season, and builds a model to help predict whether an NBA team is in the playoffs or not.

The data for this analysis were scraped from the ESPN website and contains regular-season information from 10 seasons (2010-2019). 
* The script for scraping the data can be found in the "Scripts Folder".
* The data is found in the "Data" folder.

Ultimately, this model can help determine which metrics can potentially lead to increased chance being in the playoffs, and can be useful for basketball analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts.
